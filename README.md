Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

Overview

The Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a security tool designed to monitor and analyze network traffic for malicious activities, unauthorized access, and potential cyber threats. This system helps in early detection and prevention of network attacks, ensuring enhanced cybersecurity for individuals and organizations.

Features

Real-time Network Traffic Monitoring: Continuously observes incoming and outgoing traffic.

Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns in network behavior using AI/ML techniques.

Signature-Based Detection: Matches network activity against known threat signatures.

Alert System: Generates alerts for suspicious activity with severity levels.

Logging & Reporting: Stores detected threats for further analysis.

User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive dashboard for easy monitoring.
